# There are a few changes that I have made for this homework.

1) Added 3rd party scripts for style and animation
    - anijs and animate on scroll
    - these were used in the about me, experience, and project pages
    - anijs was used for styling images on load
    - animate on scroll was used for animations 
    - scroll up and down the site

2) Edited the markup syntax for better readability
    - edited all ids and classes in html syntax such as "some-thing"

3) Added custom alert boxes for projects so the user can read descriptions
